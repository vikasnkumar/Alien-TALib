NAME
    Alien::TALib

SYNOPSIS
    Alien::TALib is a perl module that enables the installation of the
    technical analysis library TA-lib from "http://ta-lib.org" on the system
    and easy access by other perl modules in the methodology cited by
    Alien::Base.

    You can use it in the `Build.PL' file if you're using Module::Build or
    `Makefile.PL' file if you're using ExtUtils::MakeMaker.

                my $talib = Alien::TALib->new;
                die "ta-lib is not installed" unless $talib->is_installed;

                my $build = Module::Build->new(
                    ...
                    extra_compiler_flags => $talib->cflags(),
                    extra_linker_flags => $talib->libs(),
                    ...
                );

DESCRIPTION
    Installing ta-lib on various platforms can be a hassle for the end-user.
    Hence the modules like Finance::Talib and PDL::Finance::Talib may choose
    to use Alien::TALib for automatically checking and verifying that there
    are already existing installs of ta-lib on the system and if not,
    installing the ta-lib libraries on the system.

METHODS
    new This method finds an already installed ta-lib or can install it if
        not found or if the install is forced by setting the
        $Alien::TALib::FORCE variable to 1. The user can set TALIB_CFLAGS at
        runtime to override the cflags output of the object created with
        this function. The user can also set TALIB_LIBS at runtime to
        override the libs output of the object created with this function.

    cflags
        This method provides the compiler flags needed to use the library on
        the system.

    libs
        This method provides the linker flags needed to use the library on
        the system.

    ta_lib_config
        This method returns the path of the ta-lib-config executable if it
        has been installed.

    is_installed
        This method returns a boolean saying whether ta-lib has been
        installed or not.

    config
        This method provides the access to configuration information for the
        library on the system. More information can be seen in the module
        Alien::TALib::ConfigData.

SPECIAL BUILD TIME VARIABLES
    $ENV{TALIB_FORCE}
        Setting this value to 1 before running Build.PL will force the
        download and re-install of the ta-lib library.

    $ENV{TALIB_CFLAGS} and $ENV{TALIB_LIBS}
        Setting these environment variables before running Build.PL will
        force these values to be used to provide the output of cflags() and
        libs() functions. In this case is_installed() will always return 1
        and ta_lib_config() will always return undefined.

    $ENV{PREFIX}
        Setting this environment variable before running Build.PL will
        configure Alien::TALib::ConfigData to use this value as the install
        prefix of ta-lib if it is built and installed.
